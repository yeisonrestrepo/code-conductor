## Phase entry - Resume Read

Before doing anything else, restore any stored context for the current commit by running `.claude/scripts/resume-read.mjs`. It resolves the current git hash, prefers a valid DB snapshot (`conductor-db get-snapshot`), falls back to the `.claude/memory/session-snapshot.json` handoff file, and prints a `RESUME_HIT` block on a hit / nothing on a miss. Capture its stdout **and** its exit code with the canonical per-platform form (each first probes for `node` and treats its absence as a clean miss, never an error):

- **Unix / Git Bash:**
  ```sh
  if command -v node >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    resume_out="$(node .claude/scripts/resume-read.mjs 2>>.conductor/last-write.log)"; resume_rc=$?
  else resume_rc=3; resume_out=""; fi
  ```
- **PowerShell:**
  ```powershell
  if (Get-Command node -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue) {
    $__eap = $ErrorActionPreference; $ErrorActionPreference = 'Continue'
    if (Test-Path variable:PSNativeCommandUseErrorActionPreference) {
      $__nap = $PSNativeCommandUseErrorActionPreference; $PSNativeCommandUseErrorActionPreference = $false
    }
    try {
      $resume_out = node .claude/scripts/resume-read.mjs 2>> .conductor/last-write.log; $resume_rc = $LASTEXITCODE
    } catch { $resume_rc = 3; $resume_out = "" }
    finally {
      $ErrorActionPreference = $__eap
      if (Test-Path variable:__nap) { $PSNativeCommandUseErrorActionPreference = $__nap }
    }
  } else { $resume_rc = 3; $resume_out = "" }
  ```

Branch on `resume_rc` - **only `0` and `4` are meaningful; every other code proceeds fresh:**

- **`0`** → parse the captured block and adopt it as this phase's starting context, then echo one banner to the user: `> Resumed from stored snapshot @ <commit> (phase: <phase>)`, appending ` (checkpoint prose available)` when the block reports `prose: available`. Parsing (the command owns normalization): split on `\n`; strip a trailing `\r` from every line; drop leading/trailing wholly-blank lines; require `lines[0].trim() === 'RESUME_HIT'` (anything else = miss); `key: value` lines split on the first `': '` (both sides trimmed); the `pending:` block is every subsequent `^\s*-\s+` line up to the first blank line or EOF, each item trimmed. Unknown keys are ignored. In PowerShell, `node …` binds `string[]` for multi-line output - normalize with `$lines = @($resume_out)`; a `$null`/empty capture with `resume_rc = 3` is a miss.
- **`4`** → **operational halt.** Do not run this phase's normal work. Emit exactly: `SNAP_INVALID: corrupt handoff at .claude/memory/session-snapshot.json - inspect or remove it, then re-run.` and enter standby awaiting user action. The corrupt file is left on disk (the script did not delete it).
- **`3` or any other code** → **proceed fresh** (clean miss, bypass, degrade, absent `node`, or any unexpected runtime code). Ignore the capture.

`resume-read.mjs` writes its own trace lines to `.conductor/last-write.log` via `appendFileSync`; the `2>>` redirect above only sinks the incidental exit-4 halt reason away from the UI - it is not the trace channel.

## Phase 0 — Skill activation

Before doing anything else, invoke both skills in order:

```
Skill({ skill: "writing-plans", args: "$ARGUMENTS" })
Skill({ skill: "critical-review" })
```

`writing-plans` structures the format and sequencing strategy. `critical-review` Phase 1 then runs the Pre-Flight Analysis on the implementation approach — surface failure points and boundary conditions before committing to an ordered step list. Do not generate steps until both have completed.

---

Require an approved spec before starting. If no spec is in `.claude/memory/project.md` or in the recent conversation, stop and say:
"No approved spec found. Run `/cc-spec [name]` first."

Read `.claude/memory/project.md` and this project's `CLAUDE.md` before doing anything else.

**Map the codebase structure** before reading any file content:
- List directories
- Identify files related to the spec using grep, not reads
- Note existing patterns to follow

**Generate a plan with:**

## Task ID Requirements

Every task checkbox line must carry a unique alphanumeric ID:

    - [ ] [T-001] Top-level task
    - [ ] [T-001-A] Sub-task A
    - [ ] [T-001-A-1] Sub-sub-task
    - [ ] [T-002] Next top-level task

Rules:
- Minimum 3 digits (`T-001`); no upper bound (`T-1000` is valid)
- Suffix depth is unlimited: `T-NNN(-[A-Z0-9]+)*`
- IDs must be unique within the file; verify before saving; no two tasks may share the same ID
- Generated checkbox lines must use plain ASCII `[ ]` (U+0020 space only between brackets); no Unicode invisible characters
- Apply to all generated task lines only; do not add IDs retroactively to existing plan files

## Ordered Steps

Each step must include:
- Exact file path(s)
- Action (create / modify / delete)
- What changes and why
- Whether it has a dependency on a previous step

## Test List
- [ ] Unit tests for [unit]
- [ ] Integration test for [seam]
- [ ] E2E test if UI is affected

## Commit Order
[Which steps to group into commits]

## Identified Risks
[What could go wrong and how to catch it early]

---

Execute one step at a time. Confirm between steps unless the developer explicitly says to proceed without confirmation.

---

## Phase exit

Once the plan is approved and saved, instruct the user:

> "Plan complete. Run `/cc-compact` now before starting implementation."

Do not proceed to implementation without user confirmation that `/cc-compact` has been run.
